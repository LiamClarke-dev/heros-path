# Hero's Path MVP - Project Status

## Current Status: Clean Build Phase

**Last Updated**: August 2025  
**Phase**: Foundation Setup  
**Next Task**: Task 1 - Clean Project Setup and Configuration

## Project Overview

We're building Hero's Path MVP v0.1 from scratch using a clean build approach to avoid the architectural debt identified in the existing codebase (525+ lines of duplicate code, inconsistent patterns).

## Key Decisions Made

### 1. Clean Build Approach
- **Decision**: Start from scratch rather than refactor existing code
- **Rationale**: Existing codebase has too much technical debt (4 different Firebase patterns, inconsistent error handling)
- **Impact**: Faster, safer development with better architecture

### 2. Google Cloud → Firebase Setup Order
- **Decision**: Create Google Cloud project first, then add Firebase to it
- **Rationale**: Prevents linking issues between Firebase and Google APIs
- **Impact**: Proper service integration from the start

### 3. Expo SDK Throughout
- **Decision**: Leverage Expo SDK for all possible functionality
- **Rationale**: Simplified development, fewer complex integrations
- **Impact**: Faster development, more reliable implementations

### 4. Progressive Documentation
- **Decision**: Build documentation as we learn, not upfront
- **Rationale**: Avoid outdated docs and focus on what's actually needed
- **Impact**: Relevant, actionable documentation

## Current Architecture

```
MVP Scope: 6 Core Features
├── User Authentication (Google OAuth)
├── Map Navigation & GPS
├── Journey Tracking (background location)
├── Place Discovery (Google Places API New)
├── Journey Management (save/view past journeys)
└── Saved Places Management
```

## Implementation Progress

### ✅ Completed
- Comprehensive specification with requirements, design, and tasks
- External service setup instructions (Firebase, Google Cloud, Expo)
- Task sequencing and validation gates
- Quality infrastructure planning

### 🔄 In Progress
- Task 1: Clean project setup and external service configuration

### ⏳ Next Steps
- Task 2: Development infrastructure (testing, linting, validation)
- Task 3: Theme and navigation foundation
- Task 4: Authentication system

## Quality Standards

- **Test Coverage**: >85% minimum
- **Performance**: App startup <3s, GPS acquisition <5s
- **Code Quality**: ESLint + Prettier enforced via pre-commit hooks
- **API Monitoring**: Track Google Places API usage to prevent cost surprises

## Risk Mitigation

- **External Service Validation**: Test Firebase/Google API connections early (Task 2.4)
- **Integration Testing**: Validate between each major phase
- **Cost Controls**: API usage monitoring from day 1
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track metrics from foundation setup

## Success Criteria

**MVP Complete When**:
- User can complete full journey (sign-in → track → discover → save) in <5 minutes
- All performance requirements met
- >85% test coverage achieved
- Clean, maintainable codebase with no duplicate patterns
