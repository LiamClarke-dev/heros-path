# Requirements Document: App Navigation

## Introduction

The App Navigation feature provides the core navigation framework for Hero's Path, enabling users to seamlessly move between different sections of the app including Map Screen, Past Journeys, Discoveries, Saved Places, Social features, and Settings. This feature serves as the foundational user interface that connects all major app functionality, ensuring intuitive access to features while maintaining a cohesive user experience. The navigation system must support both authenticated and unauthenticated states, provide clear visual feedback, and integrate with the app's theming system for consistent styling across all screens.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Primary Navigation Structure

**User Story:** As a user, I want a clear and intuitive navigation system, so that I can easily access all major features of the app without confusion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a primary navigation interface with access to all major screens
2. WHEN a user is authenticated THEN the system SHALL show navigation options for Map Screen, Past Journeys, Discoveries, Saved Places, Social, and Settings
3. WHEN a user is not authenticated THEN the system SHALL show limited navigation options and prompt for authentication
4. WHEN a user taps a navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding screen within 200ms
5. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide visual feedback indicating the current active screen
6. WHEN the user is on any screen THEN the system SHALL provide a clear way to return to the main navigation
7. WHEN navigation items are displayed THEN the system SHALL use consistent iconography and labeling
8. WHEN the navigation interface is shown THEN the system SHALL ensure all touch targets meet accessibility guidelines (minimum 44pt)

### Requirement 2: Drawer Navigation Implementation

**User Story:** As a user, I want a slide-out navigation drawer, so that I can access different sections while preserving screen real estate for content.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user swipes from the left edge or taps the menu button THEN the system SHALL open the navigation drawer
2. WHEN the drawer is open THEN the system SHALL display all available navigation options with icons and labels
3. WHEN a user taps outside the drawer or swipes it closed THEN the system SHALL close the drawer with smooth animation
4. WHEN the drawer opens or closes THEN the system SHALL complete the animation within 300ms
5. WHEN the drawer is displayed THEN the system SHALL show the current user's profile information at the top
6. WHEN navigation items are shown in the drawer THEN the system SHALL highlight the currently active screen
7. WHEN the drawer is open THEN the system SHALL dim the background content to focus attention
8. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide proper screen reader support for drawer navigation

### Requirement 3: Tab Navigation for Core Features

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user is on core screens THEN the system SHALL display a bottom tab bar with Map, Journeys, Discoveries, and Saved Places
2. WHEN a user taps a tab THEN the system SHALL switch to that screen immediately without loading delays
3. WHEN a tab is active THEN the system SHALL provide clear visual indication through highlighting and iconography
4. WHEN tabs are displayed THEN the system SHALL use theme-appropriate colors and styling
5. WHEN the user navigates between tabs THEN the system SHALL preserve the state of each screen
6. WHEN a tab has new content or notifications THEN the system SHALL display appropriate badges or indicators
7. WHEN the device is in landscape mode THEN the system SHALL adapt the tab layout appropriately
8. WHEN accessibility features are enabled THEN the system SHALL provide proper labels and navigation hints for tabs

### Requirement 4: Authentication-Based Navigation

**User Story:** As a user, I want the navigation to adapt based on my authentication status, so that I only see features available to me.

#### Acceptance Criteria

2. WHEN a user signs in THEN the system SHALL immediately update navigation to show all authenticated features
3. WHEN a user signs out THEN the system SHALL hide authenticated features and return to the limited navigation state
4. WHEN authentication state changes THEN the system SHALL update navigation within 100ms
5. WHEN an unauthenticated user tries to access protected features THEN the system SHALL redirect to authentication flow
6. WHEN authentication is in progress THEN the system SHALL show appropriate loading states in navigation
7. WHEN authentication fails THEN the system SHALL maintain the unauthenticated navigation state
8. WHEN a user's session expires THEN the system SHALL gracefully transition to unauthenticated navigation

### Requirement 5: Deep Linking and URL Navigation

## Edge Cases and Constraints

### Edge Cases

1. **Rapid Navigation**: When users tap navigation elements rapidly, the system should queue actions and prevent navigation conflicts or crashes.
2. **Memory Pressure**: When device memory is low, the system should intelligently manage screen instances and navigation stack to prevent crashes.
3. **Authentication Timeout**: When user sessions expire during navigation, the system should gracefully handle the transition to unauthenticated state.
4. **Deep Link Conflicts**: When multiple deep links are processed simultaneously, the system should handle them in order and prevent navigation conflicts.
5. **Theme Switching During Navigation**: When themes change while navigation animations are in progress, the system should complete animations with the new theme.

### Technical Constraints

1. **React Navigation v7**: Navigation must be built using React Navigation v7 with proper TypeScript support.
2. **Performance Budget**: Navigation transitions must complete within 300ms on supported devices.
3. **Memory Limit**: Navigation stack should not exceed 10 screens to prevent memory issues.
4. **Bundle Size**: Navigation components should not increase app bundle size by more than 100KB.
5. **Platform Consistency**: Navigation behavior must be consistent across iOS and Android platforms.

### Business Rules

1. **Authentication Required**: Certain screens (Past Journeys, Social, Saved Places) require user authentication.
2. **Feature Flags**: Navigation items may be hidden based on feature flag configuration.
3. **User Permissions**: Navigation options may be limited based on user account type or permissions.
4. **Onboarding Flow**: First-time users should be guided through navigation during onboarding.
5. **Analytics Tracking**: All navigation actions should be tracked for analytics and user behavior analysis.
