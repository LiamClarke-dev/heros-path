Security Risk Assessment:
firebase - HIGH: Contains authentication tokens and database access
expo-auth-session - MEDIUM: Handles OAuth tokens and user credentials  
expo-location - MEDIUM: Accesses device location data
task-master-ai - MEDIUM: Third-party package with limited audit trail
react-native-dotenv - MEDIUM: Manages environment variables and secrets
react-native - MEDIUM: Core framework with potential security vulnerabilities

MVP Critical Path Analysis:
CRITICAL (App won't function): expo expo-location expo-maps expo-task-manager firebase react react-native react-native-maps @react-navigation/native
HIGH (Core features affected): expo-auth-session @react-native-async-storage/async-storage @expo/vector-icons @react-navigation/stack
MEDIUM (Enhanced features): @react-navigation/bottom-tabs @react-navigation/drawer react-native-gesture-handler react-native-safe-area-context
LOW (Nice to have): lottie-react-native react-native-root-toast expo-blur expo-splash-screen

Update Priority Matrix:
HIGH: firebase react react-native expo (Major versions - breaking changes likely)
MEDIUM: expo-location expo-maps expo-task-manager @expo/vector-icons (Feature updates and bug fixes)
LOW: All development dependencies and UI enhancement packages

Compatibility Concerns:
React 19.0.0 - Latest major version may have compatibility issues with some packages
Firebase 11.10.0 - Major version upgrade from v10 - potential breaking changes
Expo SDK 53 - Relatively new - some packages may not be fully compatible
task-master-ai - Third-party package with unclear maintenance status

Recommended Actions:
1. Audit firebase package for breaking changes and security updates
2. Test React 19 compatibility with all navigation packages
3. Evaluate task-master-ai package - consider removal if not essential
4. Pin critical packages to specific versions to prevent unexpected breaks
5. Regular security audits for packages with access to sensitive data
