# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The MapScreen component has grown to over 1600 lines of code and is handling multiple responsibilities including map rendering, journey tracking, saved places management, GPS status, and UI controls. This violates the Single Responsibility Principle and makes the code difficult to maintain, test, and extend. This refactoring will break down the MapScreen into smaller, focused components and custom hooks following React best practices.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Component Decomposition

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MapScreen to be broken down into smaller, focused components, so that each component has a single responsibility and is easier to maintain.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MapScreen is refactored THEN it SHALL be split into multiple focused components
2. WHEN each component is created THEN it SHALL have a single, clear responsibility
3. WHEN components are created THEN they SHALL follow React component best practices
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN the main MapScreen SHALL be under 200 lines of code (hard limit, target 150 lines)

### Requirement 2: Custom Hooks Extraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want complex state logic extracted into custom hooks, so that the logic is reusable and the components remain focused on rendering.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state management logic is identified THEN it SHALL be extracted into custom hooks
2. WHEN custom hooks are created THEN they SHALL follow React hooks conventions (use prefix)
3. WHEN hooks manage related state THEN they SHALL be grouped together logically
4. WHEN hooks are created THEN they SHALL include proper cleanup and error handling

### Requirement 3: Service Integration Abstraction

**User Story:** As a developer, I want service calls abstracted into custom hooks, so that components don't directly interact with services and the integration logic is reusable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components need service data THEN they SHALL use custom hooks instead of direct service calls
2. WHEN service hooks are created THEN they SHALL handle loading states, errors, and data caching
3. WHEN service integration changes THEN only the custom hooks SHALL need to be updated
4. WHEN hooks call services THEN they SHALL include proper error boundaries and fallbacks

### Requirement 4: UI Controls Separation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want UI controls separated into their own components, so that the map rendering logic is isolated from control logic.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN UI controls are identified THEN they SHALL be extracted into separate components
2. WHEN control components are created THEN they SHALL accept props for state and callbacks
3. WHEN controls need positioning THEN they SHALL use a layout component or positioning system
4. WHEN controls are rendered THEN they SHALL not directly access map or location services

### Requirement 5: Map Rendering Isolation

**User Story:** As a developer, I want map rendering logic isolated into its own component, so that map-specific logic doesn't interfere with other functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN map rendering is extracted THEN it SHALL be in a dedicated MapRenderer component
2. WHEN MapRenderer is created THEN it SHALL only handle map display and basic interactions
3. WHEN map data changes THEN the MapRenderer SHALL update without affecting other components
4. WHEN platform-specific map logic is needed THEN it SHALL be contained within MapRenderer

### Requirement 6: State Management Optimization

**User Story:** As a developer, I want state management optimized to prevent unnecessary re-renders, so that the app performance is improved.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN state is managed THEN it SHALL be split into logical groups to minimize re-renders
2. WHEN state updates occur THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
3. WHEN expensive operations are performed THEN they SHALL be memoized appropriately
4. WHEN context is used THEN it SHALL be split to avoid unnecessary consumer updates

### Requirement 7: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user, I want all existing functionality to work exactly the same after refactoring, so that no features are broken or changed.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN all existing features SHALL work identically
2. WHEN user interactions occur THEN they SHALL behave exactly as before
3. WHEN the app is tested THEN no regressions SHALL be introduced
4. WHEN the refactored code is deployed THEN users SHALL not notice any functional differences

### Requirement 8: Testing Improvements

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored components to be more testable, so that unit tests can be written for individual pieces of functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are refactored THEN they SHALL be easily unit testable
2. WHEN custom hooks are created THEN they SHALL be testable in isolation
3. WHEN service integration is abstracted THEN it SHALL be mockable for testing
4. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN test coverage SHALL be improved

### Requirement 9: Future-Proofing Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the refactored architecture to be extensible for future features, so that new functionality can be added without creating another monolithic component.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new map-related features are added THEN they SHALL integrate through the hook-based architecture
2. WHEN ping discovery is implemented THEN it SHALL use the existing location and map hooks
3. WHEN destination routing is added THEN it SHALL extend the map renderer without modifying core components
4. WHEN gamification features are integrated THEN they SHALL use the journey tracking hooks
5. WHEN discovery consolidation is implemented THEN it SHALL integrate through the saved places hooks
6. WHEN enhanced places integration is added THEN it SHALL extend the places overlay system
7. WHEN social sharing features are added THEN they SHALL use the journey and places data through hooks

### Requirement 10: Development Guidelines Creation

**User Story:** As a project maintainer, I want clear development guidelines documented, so that future developers and AI agents follow the modular architecture patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the refactoring is complete THEN steering documentation SHALL be updated with modular architecture guidelines
2. WHEN new features are planned THEN developers SHALL have clear guidance on using hooks and component composition
3. WHEN components exceed complexity thresholds THEN guidelines SHALL specify refactoring triggers and patterns
4. WHEN AI agents work on the codebase THEN they SHALL have specific instructions to prevent monolithic component creation
5. WHEN code reviews are conducted THEN reviewers SHALL have clear criteria for architectural compliance
