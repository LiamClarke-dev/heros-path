# Clean Slate Summary - What Was Done

## Overview

The Hero's Path project has been reset to eliminate technical debt. This document summarizes what was preserved, what was removed, and what needs to be rebuilt.

## What Was Preserved ‚úÖ

### Configuration Files
- `package.json` - All dependencies and scripts
- `app.json` - Expo configuration
- `eas.json` - Build profiles
- `babel.config.js` - Babel configuration
- `.env` - Environment variables
- `config.js` - Environment variable management
- `firebase.js` - Firebase initialization
- `index.js` - Entry point

### Assets & Documentation
- `assets/` - All images, fonts, sprites, and design tokens
- `.kiro/specs/` - Complete feature specifications (requirements, design, tasks)
- `.kiro/steering/` - Project documentation and guidelines

### Dependencies
All necessary packages are installed and ready:
- React Native 0.79.5 with React 19
- Expo SDK 53.0.19
- Firebase 11.10.0
- React Navigation v7
- All mapping and location services
- All UI and animation libraries

## What Was Removed ‚ùå

### Implementation Code
- All screens in `screens/` directory
- All components in `components/` directory
- All services in `services/` directory
- All contexts in `contexts/` directory
- All utilities in `utils/` directory
- All styling in `styles/` directory
- All constants in `constants/` directory
- All hooks in `hooks/` directory

### App.js
- Replaced complex navigation structure with simple placeholder
- Original structure documented in comments for reference

## What Was Updated üìù

### Documentation
- **README.md** - Complete rewrite reflecting clean slate status
- **product.md** - Updated development status section
- **tech.md** - Added implementation status and rebuild guidance
- **structure.md** - Marked what exists vs. what needs creation
- **onboarding.md** - NEW: Complete guide for new agents
- **clean-slate-summary.md** - NEW: This summary document

### App.js
- Replaced with minimal placeholder that runs without errors
- Includes comments explaining what needs to be rebuilt
- References the first spec to implement (User Authentication)

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Foundation (Start Here)
1. **User Authentication** - `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/user-authentication/`
2. **Map Navigation & GPS** - `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/map-navigation-gps/`
3. **Background Location** - `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/background-location/`

### Phase 2: Core Features
4. **Journey Tracking** - `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/journey-tracking/`
5. **Search Along Route** - `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/search-along-route/`

### Phase 3: User Features
Continue with Tier 2 specs in `.kiro/specs/tier-2-important/`

### Phase 4: Enhancements
Add Tier 3 features from `.kiro/specs/tier-3-enhancement/`

### Phase 5: Advanced
Complete with Tier 4 features from `.kiro/specs/tier-4-advanced/`

## Key Points for New Agents

1. **This is a complete rebuild** - Don't assume any implementation code exists
2. **Follow the specs** - Each feature has detailed requirements, design, and tasks
3. **Build incrementally** - Complete one feature fully before moving to the next
4. **Test frequently** - Use `expo start` to verify changes work
5. **Preserve architecture** - Follow the modular service-based design patterns

## Verification

To verify the clean slate setup works:

```bash
# Install dependencies (should already be done)
npm ci

# Start the app (should show placeholder screen)
expo start

# Verify build configuration works
eas build --profile development --platform ios --dry-run
```

## Next Steps

1. **New agents should start with** `.kiro/steering/onboarding.md`
2. **First implementation task**: User Authentication spec
3. **Follow the tier-based approach** outlined in the roadmap
4. **Reference steering docs** for architecture and coding standards

**Date Updated**: January 2025
**Status**: Clean slate complete, ready for implementation
