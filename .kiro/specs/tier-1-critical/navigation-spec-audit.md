- **Cross-Platform**: Consistent theming across iOS (AppleMaps) and Android (GoogleMaps)
- **Performance**: Theme changes must complete within 300ms
- **Migration Support**: Robust library migration with configuration validation

**Navigation Impact:**
- All navigation components must be theme-aware
- Map styles must integrate with navigation UI
- Settings screen needed for theme/style selection
- Performance optimization required for theme transitions

## 4. Context Scan - Overarching App Principles

### Security & Privacy (User Authentication)
- Secure authentication with multiple sign-in methods
- Persistent sessions across devices
- Privacy-first approach to user data

### Battery & Performance (Background Location)

2. **Screen Transitions**: Smooth animations between modules
3. **Deep Linking**: URL-based navigation for sharing
4. **Offline Navigation**: Graceful degradation without network

#### Integration Gaps
1. **Theme System**: Navigation components need theme awareness
2. **Authentication Flow**: Navigation must respect auth state
3. **Permission Handling**: Navigation blocked by missing permissions
4. **Error Boundaries**: Navigation-level error recovery

### Implementation Priority

#### Phase 1: Core Navigation (Week 1)
1. Refactor existing MapScreen into modular components
2. Implement basic navigation framework
3. Create journey tracking controls

#### Phase 2: Journey Flow (Week 2)
1. Implement journey summary screen
2. Add journey naming and saving workflow
3. Connect to existing BackgroundLocationService

#### Phase 3: Discovery Integration (Week 3)

3. Prepare for Search-Along-Route integration

#### Phase 4: Polish & Integration (Week 4)
1. Add theme integration points
2. Implement error boundaries
3. Performance optimization
4. Testing and validation

### Success Metrics
- **Navigation Speed**: All transitions <200ms
- **Code Maintainability**: No files >400 lines
- **Theme Integration**: All components theme-aware
- **Test Coverage**: >80% for navigation logic
- **Performance**: No memory leaks during navigation

This specification provides a clear roadmap for implementing Tier-1 Critical navigation while maintaining modularity, preventing tech debt, and preparing for future theming enhancements.
