# UI Standardization Requirements

## Introduction

Hero's Path currently has inconsistent UI patterns across modals and buttons that create a fragmented user experience and maintenance challenges. This feature will standardize all UI components to use consistent theming, styling, and interaction patterns while preserving existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Modal Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want all modals in the app to have consistent styling and behavior, so that the interface feels cohesive and professional.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any modal is displayed THEN it SHALL use theme-aware styling with consistent colors, spacing, and typography
2. WHEN the user changes themes THEN all modals SHALL immediately reflect the new theme colors and styling
3. WHEN a modal is displayed THEN it SHALL use standardized sizing options (small, medium, large, fullscreen)
4. WHEN a modal requires user input THEN it SHALL handle keyboard avoidance consistently across platforms
5. WHEN a modal is dismissed THEN it SHALL use consistent animation and transition patterns

### Requirement 2: Button System Standardization

**User Story:** As a user, I want all buttons in the app to have consistent styling and behavior, so that I can predict how interactions will work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any button is displayed THEN it SHALL use standardized variants (primary, secondary, ghost, danger)
2. WHEN buttons are positioned on the map THEN they SHALL use a consistent layout system with proper spacing
3. WHEN multiple buttons are in the same area THEN they SHALL NOT overlap or create visual conflicts
4. WHEN a button is pressed THEN it SHALL provide consistent visual feedback and interaction patterns
5. WHEN the theme changes THEN all buttons SHALL immediately reflect the new theme styling

### Requirement 3: Theme Integration Consistency

**User Story:** As a user, I want all UI components to respect my theme choice, so that the entire app has a unified appearance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any component is rendered THEN it SHALL use the useTheme() hook for theme access
2. WHEN hardcoded colors exist in components THEN they SHALL be replaced with theme color references
3. WHEN theme colors are used THEN they SHALL follow the standardized naming convention (surface, text, textSecondary, primary, border, overlay)
4. WHEN the user switches themes THEN all components SHALL update immediately without requiring app restart
5. WHEN new components are added THEN they SHALL follow the established theming patterns

### Requirement 4: Alert System Replacement

**User Story:** As a user, I want confirmation dialogs and alerts to match the app's visual design, so that the experience feels native and cohesive.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN system Alert.alert is currently used THEN it SHALL be replaced with themed custom modals
2. WHEN confirmation is needed THEN the app SHALL display a themed ConfirmationModal instead of system alerts
3. WHEN error messages are shown THEN they SHALL use themed AlertModal components
4. WHEN alerts are displayed THEN they SHALL support the same functionality as system alerts (buttons, callbacks)
5. WHEN custom alerts are used THEN they SHALL be accessible and follow platform conventions

### Requirement 5: Map Control Layout System

**User Story:** As a user, I want map controls to be clearly organized and not overlap, so that I can easily access all functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN map controls are displayed THEN they SHALL use standardized positioning zones (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right, bottom-center)
2. WHEN multiple controls are in the same zone THEN they SHALL be spaced consistently with defined margins
3. WHEN controls are positioned THEN they SHALL respect safe area boundaries on all devices
4. WHEN new controls are added THEN they SHALL follow the established layout system
5. WHEN controls overlap THEN the layout system SHALL prevent conflicts through proper spacing calculations

### Requirement 6: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the UI standardization to preserve all existing functionality, so that no features are broken during the update.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are standardized THEN all existing functionality SHALL be preserved
2. WHEN props and APIs change THEN backward compatibility SHALL be maintained where possible
3. WHEN breaking changes are necessary THEN they SHALL be clearly documented with migration paths
4. WHEN standardization is complete THEN all existing user workflows SHALL continue to work identically
5. WHEN components are refactored THEN their external interfaces SHALL remain stable

### Requirement 7: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user, I want the standardized UI components to perform well, so that the app remains responsive and smooth.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN components are re-rendered THEN they SHALL use React.memo and optimization patterns to prevent unnecessary updates
2. WHEN theme changes occur THEN only affected components SHALL re-render
3. WHEN modals are displayed THEN they SHALL not cause performance degradation in background components
4. WHEN buttons are pressed THEN the interaction feedback SHALL be immediate and smooth
5. WHEN multiple components use themes THEN the theme context SHALL be optimized to prevent cascading re-renders
