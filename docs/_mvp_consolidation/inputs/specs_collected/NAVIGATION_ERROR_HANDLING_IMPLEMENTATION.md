## Error Types Handled

### 1. Navigation Errors (10.1, 10.2)
- Component rendering failures
- Navigation action failures
- Route resolution errors
- Stack corruption

### 2. Network Errors (10.3, 10.8)
- Connection loss during navigation
- Offline state handling
- Limited functionality guidance
- Network recovery detection

### 3. Authentication Errors (10.4, 10.5, 10.6)
- Session expiration
- Invalid credentials
- Auth state synchronization
- Protected route access

### 4. State Corruption (10.5, 10.6)
- Navigation stack corruption
- State persistence failures
- Recovery from invalid states
- Checkpoint restoration

## Recovery Strategies

### 1. Retry Strategy
- Exponential backoff (1s, 2s, 4s, 8s, max 30s)
- Jitter to prevent thundering herd
- Context-aware retry limits
- Success/failure callbacks

### 2. Fallback Strategy
- Navigate to safe routes (Map, Settings, PastJourneys)
- Preserve user context when possible
- Graceful degradation of features

### 3. Reset Strategy
- Complete navigation stack reset
- Return to known good state (Map screen)
- Clear corrupted state data
- Fresh start for critical failures

### 4. State Recovery Strategy
- Restore from saved navigation state
- Use backup states when primary fails
- Validate state integrity before restoration
- Checkpoint-based recovery points

## Offline Handling

### Allowed Offline Routes
- Map (core functionality)
- Settings (app configuration)
- PastJourneys (cached data)

### Restricted Offline Features
- Social sharing
- Discovery features requiring API calls
- Real-time data synchronization
- Cloud-based features

### User Experience
- Clear offline indicators
- Feature limitation explanations
- Automatic reconnection detection
- Seamless online/offline transitions

## Logging and Monitoring

### Log Categories
- Navigation errors with stack traces
- Authentication failures with context
- Network state changes
- Recovery action results
- Performance metrics

### Error Statistics
