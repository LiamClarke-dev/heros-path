# Specification Architecture Update - Service-Centric Consolidation

## üéØ **Specifications Updated**

All location-related specifications have been updated to reflect the new **service-centric architecture** that eliminates duplicate processing and establishes BackgroundLocationService as the single source of truth.

## üìã **Updated Specification Files**

### 1. **Background Location Tracking** ‚úÖ
**File**: `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/background-location/design.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Updated architecture diagram to show consolidated processing
- Added two-stream processing responsibility to BackgroundLocationService
- Updated `stopTracking()` method to return both journey and display data streams
- Added `getCurrentProcessedData()` method for real-time updates
- Updated MapScreen integration to use service-centric approach
- Emphasized single source of truth architecture

### 2. **Journey Tracking & Recording** ‚úÖ
**File**: `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/journey-tracking/design.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Updated data processing architecture section to emphasize service-centric approach
- Modified BackgroundLocationService interface to show consolidated processing
- Updated MapScreenState to reflect service-processed data
- Added `getCurrentProcessedData()` method specification
- Emphasized elimination of duplicate processing

**File**: `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/journey-tracking/requirements.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Updated Requirement 7 to specify BackgroundLocationService as processor
- Added Requirement 7.8 for single source of truth
- Updated Requirements 6.3, 6.4, 6.6 to emphasize service processing

**File**: `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/journey-tracking/tasks.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Updated Task 2.3 to emphasize service-centric processing
- Added elimination of duplicate processing as explicit task
- Updated requirements references to include new requirement 7.8

### 3. **Map Navigation & GPS** ‚úÖ
**File**: `.kiro/specs/tier-1-critical/map-navigation-gps/design.md`

**Key Changes**:
- Updated MapScreenState to show service-processed data streams
- Removed raw data references (now handled internally by service)
- Emphasized service-processed data for both journey and display paths

## üèóÔ∏è **Architectural Changes Documented**

### **Before (Problematic)**
```
Raw GPS ‚Üí useJourneyTracking (processing) ‚Üí BackgroundLocationService (duplicate processing)
```

### **After (Consolidated)**
```
Raw GPS ‚Üí BackgroundLocationService (single processing) ‚Üí useJourneyTracking (UI state only)
```

## üìä **Key Specification Updates**

### **Data Flow Documentation**
- **Single Source of Truth**: BackgroundLocationService handles ALL processing
- **No Duplicate Processing**: Eliminated redundant filtering
- **Clear Separation**: Service = Data Processing, Hook = UI State Management

### **Interface Updates**
- **stopTracking()**: Now returns both journey and display data streams
- **getCurrentProcessedData()**: New method for real-time service data access
- **Service-Centric Integration**: Updated MapScreen integration patterns

### **Requirement Updates**
- **Requirement 7.8**: Added explicit single source of truth requirement
- **Updated Processing Requirements**: All specify BackgroundLocationService as processor
- **Consolidated Processing**: Emphasized service-centric approach throughout

## üéØ **Benefits for Future Agents**

### **Clear Architecture**
- Specifications now clearly document the service-centric approach
- No ambiguity about where processing should happen
- Single source of truth principle established

### **Consistent Documentation**
- All location-related specs use consistent terminology
- Service responsibilities clearly defined
- Hook responsibilities clearly separated

### **Implementation Guidance**
- Clear patterns for service integration
- Explicit data flow documentation
- Consolidated processing approach documented

## üîç **Verification Checklist**

Future agents can verify the architecture by checking:

- ‚úÖ **BackgroundLocationService**: Handles all data processing
- ‚úÖ **useJourneyTracking**: Manages UI state only
- ‚úÖ **No Duplicate Processing**: Single processing pipeline
- ‚úÖ **Service Integration**: Components get processed data from service
- ‚úÖ **Consistent Specs**: All location specs reflect service-centric approach

## üìö **Related Documentation**

- `ARCHITECTURE_CONSOLIDATION.md` - Technical implementation details
- `TWO_STREAM_IMPLEMENTATION.md` - Original two-stream approach
- `TWO_STREAM_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - Cleanup and consolidation summary

## üöÄ **Impact**

The specification updates ensure that:
- **Future agents** understand the service-centric architecture
- **Implementation consistency** is maintained across features
- **No duplicate processing** is accidentally reintroduced
- **Clear separation of concerns** is preserved
- **Single source of truth** principle is documented and enforced

All location-related specifications now accurately reflect the consolidated, service-centric architecture that eliminates duplicate processing and provides a clean, maintainable foundation for future development.
